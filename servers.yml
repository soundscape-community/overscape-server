# Provide a list of URLs, each optionally with a list of URLs to polygon files
# specifying the boundaries of the data loaded into the server at that URL. If
# no bounding polygon is specified, the URL is assumed to cover the entire
# world.
#
# When a tile is requested, the first URL in the list that contains the
# relevant geographical region will be used.
#
# Example with two Overpass servers, the first covering Europe and North
# America, and the second covering the planet:
#
#   - url: "https://overpass.kumi.systems/api/interpreter/"
#     bounds:
#     - "https://download.geofabrik.de/north-america.poly"
#     - "https://download.geofabrik.de/europe.poly"
#   - url: "https://overpass.kumi.systems/api/interpreter/"
